    <h4>Q1. Create one function with zero parameter having a console statement</h4>

    <pre>
        function printMessage() {
            console.log("Hello, this is a function with zero parameters!");
          }
          
          printMessage();

    </pre>

    <h4>Q2. Create one function which takes two values as a parameter and <br>
         print the sum of them as "Sum of 3, 4 is 7"</h4>

    <pre>
        function printSum(a, b) {
            const sum = a + b;
            console.log(`Sum of ${a}, ${b} is ${sum}`);
          }
        
          printSum(3, 4);

    </pre>

    <h4>Q3. Create one arrow function</h4>

    <pre>
        const multiply = (a, b) => {
            return a * b;
          };
        
        const result = multiply(5, 3);
        console.log(result); // Output: 15

            Q4. "Print output: 
            var x = 21;
            var girl = function () {
                console.log(x);

        </b>
    </pre>

    <pre>
        
        The output of the code will be undefined.

        Explaination:
        var x = 21;: Here, a variable x is declared and initialized with the value 21
        console.log(x) It tries to print the value of the variable x. 
        However, there is a issue due to hoisting.
        var x = 20  Inside the function, a new variable x is declared and 
        initialized with the value 20. 
        This declaration takes priorty due to hoisting.

        "hoisting," means that variable declarations are moved 
        to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. 
        However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

        The output of the code will be
        undefined
        21

        Explaination:
        Undefined comes due to hosting as explained in above question
        var x = 21 variable is declared and initialized with the value 21
        and printed correctly in line 3 of code 
        so out put gives as 21

        The output of the code will be

        Explaination:
        we declared and initialized with the value 21
        and in the function assigned the value 20
        and printing it.
        similarly we are doing same in another function 
        calling both functions

        The output of the code will be:

        i am from PrepBytes and My batch is EA19

        Explaination:
        we declared a function with parameters a and b and returing their sum.

        another function with parameters data and batch varibles and 
        print them as template literals
        
        finally giving values for second function as 
        first is string for data variable 
        and second is giving function as value to batch

    <pre>
        The output of the code will be
        The code will result in a ReferenceError: Abc is not a function.\


        Explaination:
        Here we are storing the function in a variable
        and calling before it is assigning to the variable
        in java script the assign will happen after running the code and 
        declarations are hoisted as explained above.

        so it throws an error

        Explaination:
        var a = 10 A variable a is declared and initialized with the value 10.

        (function () { ... })();: This is an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE). 
        It's a way to create a function and execute it immediately. 
        console.log(a) It tries to log the value of the variable a.

        The output of the code will be:

        Explaination:
        First we declared a function with parameter name and 
        which is returning another function
        that another function having a print statement in template literals
        with parameters of fist function and returing function

        lastly they created a variable and assigned value to first function
        and using that created variable he assigned the value to return function 
        which helps to run both functions and with assigned values
